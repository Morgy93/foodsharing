⚠️ ⚠️ Please read this! ⚠️ ⚠️

It's not broken, and it's not a new feature: could be a minor or a major improvement that's needed. Maybe there's a need for a layout change. Maybe you know of a way to improve the user experience. As long as it's not a bug or a feature proposal, this is your template.

Before suggesting an improvement, make sure to search for any existing issues that might be about the same topic. You can view the list of open issues here:

https://gitlab.com/foodsharing-dev/foodsharing/issues

Please understand that we have very few developers who can work on features, so please don't expect any immediate response.

You are welcome to chat with the developers in slack:
