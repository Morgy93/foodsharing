## Releases notes

Our first release using the new approach, yay!

This release contains some important structural improvements, perhaps most significantly,
we are now using composer for dependencies where possible, and running on php7.

There are also a good number of smaller, but visible changes to the site, mostly bugfixes, but
a few new features too.

Many many thanks to all the contributors that made this possible (in order of appearance in the changelog):
