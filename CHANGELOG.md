# 2019-05-17 Hotfix

- Clarify message when you cannot sign up for a pickup.
@NerdyProjects has been working on the pickup backend in the last months so the website does not allow you to sign up for pickups that are further in the future than the setting in the store allows (1-4 weeks).
The frontend does not yet follow that behaviour (showing pickup slots always for more days than allowed to sign up), but if you want to sign up, the backend disallows that and you get an error message.
@NerdyProjects currently works on redoing the pickup frontend as well and we hopefully get it shiny in a few days :-)
- fixed the switched store publicity settings @peter.toennies

# 2019-02-21

We are happy to announce another release which got hundreds of hours of love, lastly from more then 10 people participating in the 2019 february foodsharing.de hackweek, sitting together since last friday at Kanthaus near Leipzig.

This release is a milestone as we finally managed to tackle some issues that increase the security of foodsharing.de and by that the privacy of all our users.

We are very proud to finally release foodsharing with an **AGPLv3** licence, making it finally a [Free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).

## Major changes
- A security focussed code audit has been done by @alangecker which lead to fixing more than 50 related issues, from which 10 were of critical and 6 of high severity #472
- AGPLv3 licence added. The [Gitlab repository](https://gitlab.com/foodsharing-dev/foodsharing) is now publically visible
- [CSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) protection for most requests to avoid malicious requests deleting accounts or changing data without the users intention to do so
- Lots of [XSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) vectors have been closed by setting the correct content type on json responses
- Removed backend code to stop old android app *foodsharing lebensmittelretten* (*de.lebensmittelretten.app*) from working. The development team cannot take the responsibility for using this app as it implements very bad practices regarding security. We advice all current and recent users of that app to change the password they used on foodsharing.de.
- We are happy with the continuous process of cleaning up our code and reimplementing more and more parts as proper API requests and getting rid of spaghetti-javascript

A spontaneous hack-weekend led to us finally finishing this release.
The new topbar is the main feature, paired with a lot of bugfixes of all the things we broke with the last release and the new topbar.
Another big thing to note is that we accidentally removed support for a lot of browsers with the last release which should have been fixed again:
IE11, Safari and slightly older androids should work again, although I can only ask you to please always keep your devices and browsers up to date!

## Features
- new topbar in vue.js !451, #11, #15, #155, #158, #30, #66, #67, #93 @alangecker

We are quite good at doing major releases every three months.
So here we go:
- Enjoy a new shiny forum post view, using a modern implementation in vue.js / bootstrap-vue
- We now require a javascript enabled browser, as we are using more and more modern frontend technologies
- Forum posts will finally not only allow you to use `whatever <you> want to type Â«Â»Ã¤Ã¡<>>>< in there, but also styling using *markdown*`. See [Wikipedia: Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) for an introduction on how to use that
- Behind the scenes, we achieved a lot more, that you hopefully don't notice. See the list below for all changes.

You can read a bit more about the recent weeks and happenings of the developers in the [Development Blog: Summer hackweek](https://devblog.foodsharing.de/2018/07/16/summer-hackweek.html).
