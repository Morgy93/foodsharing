/*
 * The purpose of this is to wrap the eslint command to specify the correct paths.
 * By default it is not happy to include a whole directory at a higher level, but we need
 * this to lint the files included in ../src.
 *
 * However, it is happy to include individual files, so we do the glob ourselves, and pass that
 * to eslint.
 *
 * This command will pass all the other args through so you can use it like normal!
