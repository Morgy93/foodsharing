# Welcome fellow developer!

Hi! You probably came here from one of the foodsharing platforms,
[foodsharing.de](https://foodsharing.de/) or
[foodsharing.at](https://foodsharing.at/), and want to start (FIXME: to develop|developing) with
us. Great!

This documentation wants to give you an [overview](introduction/overview.html)
of the current projects, and how we [communicate]() and [work]() with each
other.

On which [tasks](contribute/tasks.html) we are working now,
which [issues](contribute/issues.html) and [plans](contribute/milestones.html) we have.


 - report an issue (what issues can be fixed soon?)
 - newbie guide: walkthrough: how to create an issue?
 - join slack, who are we?
 - get an overview of the foodsharing project, tasks, milestones
 - newbie guide: walkthrough: fix a simple issue (e.g. typo in documentation)
 - get an overview of other projects


> **Info** **The more you know**
> If you are new to slack you can jump right in or read some [introduction](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115004071768) first.

Perhaps you want to [find other interesting yunity channels](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205239967-Browse-and-join-channels)?


 - FAQ: where is help needed and what is a good place to start? [Neomutt](https://www.neomutt.org/) (see: I want to help NeoMutt) is very clever (kudos!) and motivating here by:

 1. assuring that **any** help is appreciated,
 2. making it possible to start: by dividing problems in easier ones (not necessarily coding) and an [accompanying guide](https://www.neomutt.org/dev/newbie-tutorial)
 3. providing challenges/a perspective. The willingness to learn is more important than knowledge/skill. Harder problems might be solveable in the future.

 - a small tutorial/detailed instructions to set everything up (skipable for experienced devs)

## Motivation

 - when I started using Ubuntu ~10 years ago I really appreciated their [welcome letter](https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Einsteiger/Brief_an_einen_Windowsnutzer/). I would appreciate something similar. It should be motivating and answer the following questions:

 - FAQ: What projects are there and what are they for?
 - FAQ: how is the development coordinated? how do you communicate? (slack, gitlab, github)
     - slack: join foodsharing-dev. welcome message, e.g.: “Nice to have you here. Please feel free to give us an introduction on who you are, how you feel and what you would like to do (e.g. What are your skills and what do you like doing?)” -- Matthias

 - FAQ: who does what? (preferences and topics of fellow devs)
