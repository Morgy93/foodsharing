# To do

- remove "published with gitbook" link
- flexible alerts for prerequisites: https://github.com/zanfab/gitbook-plugin-flexible-alerts
- tidy up unused folders and md files in docs folder (either include content into new structure or toss away completely)
- use the following information:
## Services

In `/src/Services` we have services.

## Sockets

In `/src/Sockets`, we have sockets. We use them to reduce the use of [`func.inc.php`](php.md).


# Done

- fix script so html files are not in ``docs/``
- remove fb/twitter icons, include foodsharing icon instead
- switch serve log level to info
