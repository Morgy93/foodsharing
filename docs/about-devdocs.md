# About the devdocs

Feel free to provide feedback or ask questions at the #foodsharing-dev [Slack](https://slackin.yunity.org/) channel at any time.

## General information

The developer documentation (devdocs) contains general information about the foodsharing website project, step-by-step instructions, and references.

## Target groups of the devdocs

The devdocs should offer everything newcomers need to start participating in the foodsharing website project.

The devdocs should also be of help to anyone that got stuck while working on the foodsharing website project and is in need of help.

## Contributing to the devdocs

Anyone can contribute to the devdocs. The git project folder is called `docs`.

The devdocs are based on the following principles:

- Information should be correct and current
- Information should be consistent (language, formatting,...)
- Information should be concise (but some repetition is necessary)
- Information should be complete (probably an infeasible ideal)

But don't worry too much about the last three principles. There are people solely dedicated to improving the devdocs.

## GitBook

The devdocs are based on [GitBook](https://docs.gitbook.com/).
