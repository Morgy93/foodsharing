# Services

Currently, in our source code, some code that assists controllers can be found
in classes named "Service": `/src/Services`.
Some of these classes are Transaction classes that need to be renamed, and some
of them are utility classes. `/src/Services/SanitizerService.php` is the best
example for that.

Some code in the services should rather go into the modules if they
belong to a specific module.
