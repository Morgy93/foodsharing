# Getting the code

We use the version control system git.
The code is hosted on [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/foodsharing-dev/foodsharing).
We are Open Source so you can just clone the repo and start exploring.

To get the possibility to push branches and create Merge Requests,
create an Gitlab account, apply for becoming a member and tell a bit about you on the [Slack](https://slackin.yunity.org/) channel.

For Git, we recommend to use SSH (and the following documentation is supposing that). See e.g. [this documenation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ssh/README.html) if you need to configure GitLab for this.

For first use of git search for tutorials, there are a lot good ones out there.

For exploring the project, check [Running the code](running-the-code.md) and [Setting things up](setting-things-up.md) afterwards. For contributing like writing issues and creating merge requests, check out the [Contributing section](contributing.md).
