# Internationalization

There are three ways how fixed texts on the website is given in the source code.
Since at some point we want the code to be free from German-specific texts to enable non-German speakers to use the site and to make it easier for groups in other countries to use the code.
- Hardcoded text (obviously legacy code), e.g.
```
$this->func->addContent('<...>Updates-Ãœbersicht<...>')
```
Do not create more of this hardcoded german!
- References to the translation files in `/lang/DE/....php` via the function `s` in `/src/Lib/Func.php`, e.g.
```
$this->func->s('close_foodbaskets')
```
- References to the translation file `/lang/lang.de.yml`.
TODO: describe how to use this data. It has something to do with symfony.
This is the way to go when you create new text on the website.
