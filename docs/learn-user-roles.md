# Roles and Permissions

After setting up a local foodsharing instance, you will get to know many workflows and actions
that are not available to you on foodsharing itself, due to limited roles and permissions.

With access to both the seed data and the database, those limitations no longer exist!
Go and play around with some of the local users, or keep reading for a brief overview and explanation.

## Roles

Users have a "quiz role" which signifies the level to which they can help manage the foodsharing platform.
The most prominent promotion steps are
- from Foodsharer to Foodsaver (the "Foodsaver-Quiz"), which eventually allows you to pick up food in cooperating stores
- from Foodsaver to Store Manager (the "Betriebsverantwortlichen-Quiz"), which enables you to become responsible for cooperations
- from Store Manager to Ambassador (the "Botschafter\*innen-Quiz"), which enables you to become ambassador for regions (districts)

In addition to the above, there are also a few select users with global Orga permissions.

### Foodsharer

TODO

### Foodsaver

TODO

### Store Manager

- can be asked to manage any stores in regions which they are part of
- has accepted the privacy notice regarding sensitive user data (*Vertraulichkeitserkl√§rung*)

The following assumes the user is store manager for at least one store, although you can
of course have passed the Store Manager Quiz and not be managing any store at the moment.

- is displayed at the top of "their" store-team list, for people to contact
- can add and remove store team members, can accept and reject store-team applications
- can move people to and from waiting list, chat with waiting list
- can edit the store properties, team status and what's displayed on the foodsharing map
- can edit the pickup times (repeated ones and one-time pickups)
- can confirm and reject pickup slots
- can see the pickup history (past slots)

### Ambassador

The following assumes the user is ambassador for at least one region, although you can
of course have passed the Ambassador Quiz and not be acting Ambassador at the moment.

- can manage the profiles of foodsharers and foodsavers with that region as home region (*Stammbezirk*)
- can manage the foodsaver passports of people from that region
- are displayed in the left sidebar of "their" region's forums, for people to contact
- can perform store manager actions on any stores in that region
- can manage any local workgroup in the region

### Orgateam
- basically allowed to see and do anything, but remember: with great power comes great responsibility ;-)
- just browse the pages in the gear-icon menu entry and discover e.g. the internal content management system

## Permissions

There are many different things you might manage, for example...
- a workgroup
- a store
- an event
- a foodsharepoint
- a region
- a foodsaver profile
- a newsletter
- a poll
- a foodsaver passport (*Ausweis*)
- a blogpost
- a food basket
- content in the internal CMS
- quiz questions

In each of those situations (and there are more!) you'll be allowed or not allowed to perform actions
based on the permissions for this context.
Hopefully over time, we can briefly outline what's what and which things to look out for!

Many of the computations have already been extracted, and you can find them as part of a
[Permissions class](php-structure.md#permissions) for the respective module.
In several other cases though, the checks for what you are and aren't allowed to do are implicit,
meaning they are implemented inline throughout the code.
We're trying to extract them wherever possible when working on code nearby,
and only introduce "clean" permission handling in new code.

Recently, we have also started introducing special workgroups which can take over certain predefined duties
that previously belonged to ambassadors only (or did not exist separately at all).
Those so-called workgroup functions currently are:
- greeting foodsavers who join a region and need introductory pickups (*Welcome Group*)
- managing foodshare points of a region (regardless of who's listed as responsible for the point)
- managing polls for a region (voting is a very new feature, so this is still under construction)

Those groups are optional and right now need to be set up by Orgateam members for a region.
Some of them will also show up in the forum sidebar, similar to the ambassador list.
