# Helper scripts

There are a number of helper scripts available. Most of them obey the `FS_INT` env var. Default is `dev`, you can also set it to `test`.

| ./scripts/initdb       | Create the database and run migrations |
| ./scripts/lint         | runs all lintings scripts lint-... |
| ./scripts/lint-js      | lints javascript and vue files: prints errors etc. |
| ./scripts/lint-markdown [files\|directories\|globs] | lints markdown files: prints errors etc. NOTE: Custom args must originate from `client/` directory (e.g. `../README.md` for root file) |
| ./scripts/lint-php     | lints php files: prints errors etc. |
| ./scripts/mkdirs       | Create directories that need to be present (called by other scripts) |
| ./scripts/mysql        | Run `mysql` command in correct context: `./scripts/mysql foodsharing "select * from fs_foodsaver"` |
| ./scripts/mysqldump    | Run `mysqldump` command in correct context |
| ./scripts/php-cs-fixer | |
| ./scripts/php-cs-fixer.ci.sh | |
| ./scripts/rebuild-all  | |
| ./scripts/rebuild-container | |
| ./scripts/rebuild-test-data | |
| ./scripts/rm           | Shut down and clean up all containers |
| ./scripts/run          | |
| ./scripts/seed         | Run seed scripts in `scripts/seeds/*.sql` |
| ./scripts/start        | Start everything, initializing anything if needed, see [Setting things up](setting-things-up.md) |
| ./scripts/stop         | Stop everything, but leave it configured see [Setting things up](setting-things-up.md) |
| ./scripts/test         | Run tests |
| ./scripts/test-chat    | Run test for the chat |
| ./scripts/test-js      | Run test for the client (JS) |
| ./scripts/test-rerun   | Run tests without recreating db (faster that test) |
| ./scripts/watch-assets | Builds the static assets on change |

## Nightly maintenance

Using the `docker-compose` you can run various php-scripts, e.g.
```
./scripts/docker-compose run --rm --no-deps app php -f run.php Stats foodsaver
./scripts/docker-compose run --rm --no-deps app php -f run.php Stats betriebe
./scripts/docker-compose run --rm --no-deps app php -f run.php Stats bezirke
```
This runs the statistics scripts that are run nightly on the production server.
This can be necessary to test code concerning statistics since they are usually never run locally.
`--rm` removes the containers afterwards, `--no-deps` lets docker not worry about any dependendent containers. This is often useful since they are often running already.
