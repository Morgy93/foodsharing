## Information on the app setup and others: useful links

If you join [the Android Repo](https://gitlab.com/foodsharing-dev/foodsharing-android/), you will find all information on the setup there for development setup instructions on Ubuntu based OSes: refer to /docs/dev-setup-ubuntu.md . (Not in this repository)
It is always good to read the [Readme-File]( https://gitlab.com/foodsharing-dev/foodsharing-android/-/blob/master/README.md) for the android project.

There is also a [Readme-File for the iOS-Project](https://gitlab.com/foodsharing-dev/foodsharing-ios/-/blob/master/ReadMe.md) , and a [Readme-File for the webpage](https://gitlab.com/foodsharing-dev/foodsharing/-/blob/master/README.md)

If you want to dive deeper into the infos earlier developers have hidden throughout the project, you'll find here [information on the homepage (like a flyer and a list of responsibilities)](https://gitlab.com/foodsharing-dev/foodsharing/-/wikis/home).
