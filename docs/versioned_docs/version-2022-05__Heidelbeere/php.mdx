# PHP

This page describes broadly how PHP is used in our project:

- [Main entry point](#main-entry-point)
- [Autoloading](#autoloading)
- [Service classes](#services)
- [Automatic service injection](#automatic-service-injection)
- [Syntax](#syntax)
- [Conventions / Coding Style](#conventions)

For more specific explanations of the types of classes we use, make sure to check [PHP Structure](./php-structure)!

## Main entry point

The main entry point for the web is `/index.php`.
That means that `/index.php` gets called whenever a `https://foodsharing.de`-request gets sent to the website.

Another entry point is `xhr.php`, which is used for routes starting with `https://foodsharing.de/xhr.php`. These are
used for our legacy API (see [Xhr](./requests#xhr)). The same applies for `xhrapp.php`.

These three entry points are now just standard Symfony entry points.
The relevant (custom) code has been moved to `src/Entrypoint`, where three respective controllers do the actual work.
For the `IndexController`, a large part of the code has been moved to `src/EventSubscriber/RenderControllerSetupSubscriber.php`.

The fourth entry point is `restApi.php`, which will be used whenever a URL starting with `https://foodsharing.de/api` is
requested. This is the route to our modern API following REST principles (see [REST-API](./requests#rest-api)).
It is also a standard Symfony entry point.
