/**
 * Statistics update operations for foodsaver, store team and region stats.
 *
 * For performance reasons all operations are based on single SQL-queries.
 * To give everyone some understanding of how these queries work, I will explain
 * their basic structure here.
 *
 * All queries follow the following scheme:
 *
 * UPDATE table_name t                   table_name is the table to be changed, t its alias
 * LEFT OUTER JOIN (                     To update the table, other values need to be queried.
 *                                       This is done via subqueries, which are added via
 * 										 LEFT OUTER JOIN. This way, there will be a value for
 *                                       every row of table t, which may be NULL if the subquery
 *                                       finds no result for that row.
 *     SELECT                            This is a subquery, which is just a SELECT-statement to
 *                                       query the data needed for the update.
 *         any_id_column AS id,          This is the id. It is used to join the selected data with
 *                                       the table to be updated.
 *         AGG_FCT(any_column) AS column This is where most of the magic happens. The SELECT
 *                                       statements contain many results per id. All of these are
 *                                       combined using an aggregate function (here AGG_FCT), which
 *                                       is usually COUNT or SUM. These function combine all values
 *                                       from one group (see 5 lines down) into one value.
 *         [more columns]                From some subqueries more than one value is selected.
 *                                       Typically it is just one however.
 *     FROM other_table_name             The table from which the data is queried, possibly ...
 *     [more JOINed tables]              joined with some other tables if the data cannot be infered
 *                                       from just one table.
 *     WHERE <condition>                 A typical WHERE clause. This limits the data to be included.
 *     GROUP BY any_id_column            For aggregate functions to work properly, it must be defined
 *                                       which rows of data should be combined / grouped into one.
 *                                       This line does exactly that, by grouping all values, whose
 *                                       value of the any_id_column is equal, meaning all values
 *                                       corresponding to one row of the table t are grouped.
 * ) AS subquery_name                    Assign a name to the subquery
 * ON name.id = t.id                     Link the subquery to the table to be updated by their ids.
 * [more LEFT OUTER JOINS]               Depending on the values that should be updated, more queries
 *                                       might be needed. These follow the same basic structure.
 * SET                                   The SET keyword introduces the section, in which values of
 *                                       the table are acutally updated.
 *     t.some_stat = IFNULL(             The column some_stat of table t recieves a new value. This
 *         subquery_name.column,         value is the value of the subquery, if that is not NULL, and
 *         default_value                 a default value otherwise.
 *     )
 *     [more coulums to be updated]      Multiple columns might be updated at once.
 *
 *
 * Apart from all that, the queries in this class use Database::execute, which is
 * deprecated and should not be used if not necessary. Using fetch would work as
 * well, but would be misleading, since it would not be used for fetching data.
