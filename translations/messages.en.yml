    the food is still edible.

  respect: "To preserve groceries we want to treat them respectfully. To ensure everything
    runs optimally, we have defined a few behaviour rules over the years. Sharing

    etiquette!"

    food is put to good use instead of being thrown away. You can find more information

  description: You can join your first district by clicking through to your district
    starting with <em>Europe</em> and your country. If you don’t find a district for
    you, choose a level higher or join the nearest district. If you don’t have the
    opportunity to train as a food saver in the area, you can consider starting your
    own district. In this case, please read the wiki carefully, in particular the
    <a href="{href}">article on founding or reactivating districts<a>. If you want
    to start the district or have explicit questions that the wiki doesn’t answer,
    send us a <a href="{mail}">mail</a>. We’re not a central point for questions of
    all kinds, but we can help with district-related questions.
