    main: "The Fairteiler is like a \"transshipment point\" for food, to which you\
      \ can bring food and take it from there for free. A shelf and/or a refrigerator\
      \ serves as a Fairteiler. You can find our Fairteiler in easily accessible places\
      \ such as in private or communal rooms, on university campuses, in club rooms,\
      \ and much more. The Fairteiler can be registered on our platform and thus be\
      \ displayed on a map for all users.\n\nThere are Fairteiler with regulated opening\
      \ hours and those that are accessible around the clock.\nOur Fairteiler rules\
      \ and requirements, such as the hygiene plan and the responsibility of a responsible\
      \ foodsaver, must be observed in all cases."

    can get to know our activities and members in your district and work with them
    for a good cause.

    involved with thousands of like-minded people against food waste.
  joinheader: Get active and help saving food!
  howitworks_main: What is behind our initiative and how can you get involved? We
    answer these and other questions in this video.
  howitworksheader: How does foodsharing work?
  welcome_main_5: The members of the foodsharing community work on a voluntary basis
    and free of charge. The foodsharing initiative is and will remain free, non-commercial,
    independent and free of advertising. We want to make the platform open source
    and more easily accessible worldwide - just like the foodsharing concept of saving
    food.
  welcome_main_4: The foodsharing initiative was launched in Berlin in 2012. In the
    meantime it has grown into an international movement with over 300,000 registered
    users in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and other European countries.
  welcome_main_3: The organization of our foodsharing community and our activities
    is primarily carried out via the online platform foodsharing. This is where the
    food rescuers network and coordinate in the individual cities and regions. National
    topics, events and information are published on the platform.
  welcome_main_2: In addition, we see ourselves as an educational movement and feel
    committed to sustainable environmental and consumption goals. Among other things,
    we are campaigning for a throw-away stop and against the packaging madness in
    supermarkets. We are present at events or in the media with these and other topics
    and start our own campaigns.
  welcome_main_1: We are an initiative that works against food waste. We "save" unwanted
    and overproduced food in private households and in small and large businesses.
